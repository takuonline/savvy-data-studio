
##   prompt templates
- these are very powerfull
- image giving a user the ability to create a prompt template


**prompt_template**

```
You are an Ai recipe assistant that speciallizes in {dietary_preference} dishes that cna be prepared in {cooking_time}
```

prompt_template(
    dietary_preference = "meaty",
    recipe_request="Quick Snack"
)

Now this can be used like a fun tion that takes in data as input and

### consider Few shot prompt template
- this is essentially an auto complete.

- You give historic behaviour and ask what it thinks it will be like for the model to extrapolate

> Eg:
 - if 1+1 = 2, what do you think 2+2 will be?
 - if discount on promo and off promo are like this, what do oyu think off promo only is like



I am trying to  build a tool that will allow for complex llm use for users to chain different operations and write complex chains. It the tech stack is django and nextjs 14. Now what things can l build into this to to make it useful for users. Give advice as an very intelligent model business minded model with User experience in mind
ChatGPT
Creating a tool that harnesses the power of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT for complex chained operations involves a multi-faceted approach. Here are some suggestions to make it useful for users, keeping a business-oriented and user-experience perspective in mind:

Intuitive User Interface: Since your users will be building complex chains of operations, the user interface must be straightforward. Use drag-and-drop components, clear visual elements that represent different operations, and tooltips that guide the user through the process of creating these chains.

Templates and Examples: Provide users with templates and examples of common operation chains. This helps them get started and also provides a learning tool for understanding how to create their own.

Customizable Components: Allow users to create and save their own custom operations or chains that they can reuse. This will save time and make the tool more efficient for power users.

Collaboration Features: Enable features for users to collaborate on chains, share their work with others, and provide feedback within the tool. This could include version control systems, commenting, and shared workspaces.

Scalability: Ensure that the tool can handle an increasing number of operations and users without significant performance loss. This may involve optimizing backend operations and ensuring that the system can scale horizontally.

Security and Privacy: Implement robust security measures to protect user data. This includes secure authentication methods, data encryption, and compliance with privacy laws.

Integration Capabilities: Provide integration with other tools and platforms. APIs, webhooks, and plugins can extend the usability of your tool and allow it to fit into the existing tech stack of your users.

User Education: Offer comprehensive documentation, video tutorials, and live support to educate your users on the best ways to use the tool. This should also include best practices for LLM usage.

Feedback Loop: Establish a feedback loop that allows users to report issues, request features, and suggest improvements. This will help you to iterate on the tool and ensure that it continues to meet user needs.

Monitoring and Analytics: Incorporate monitoring tools to track usage patterns and performance metrics. This data can guide future updates and optimizations.

Accessibility: Make sure the tool is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for best practices.

Performance Optimization: Since you are using Django and Next.js, ensure that the tool is optimized for performance, especially for the dynamic rendering of complex operation chains.

Adaptation and Learning: Implement features that allow the tool to learn from user interactions and suggest optimizations or improvements to the operation chains.

Mobile Responsiveness: Although the complex nature of the tool may be best suited for desktop, ensure that it's usable on mobile devices or consider providing a companion app for on-the-go access.

Cost Management: Provide users with insights into the cost of operations, especially if you are interfacing with paid APIs or services, and offer tools for managing and forecasting expenses.

By focusing on these areas, you can create a tool that not only leverages the power of LLMs but also provides a seamless and productive user experience
